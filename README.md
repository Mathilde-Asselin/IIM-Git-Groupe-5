## :tools: Installation

Create a .env file and ask for the secrets.

Build & launch the project

npm i
npm run dev


Easy no?

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from master;
2. Push the branch as often as you want
3. Once you're done, create a pull request based on master and tag it appropriately
4. Once the branch is merged, delete it

### Golden rules

* If you need to share your work before it is done, create the pull request as draft
